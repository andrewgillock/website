    title: "About Me"
    image: /images/me.jpg
    content: |-
      I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas. 
      I enjoy spending my free time outside whether it's paddleboarding, hiking, tennis, basketball, or just going for a walk. 
      My favorite sports teams are the San Antonio Spurs and the Texas Longhorns! 
      I'll listen to most types of music, but country, jazz, and hip-hop are some of my favorites. I'm always welcome to new recommendations as well.
      
      I've been fortunate to attend the University of Texas at Austin for both undergrad and graduate school.
      Studying biology during my time as an undergraduate student introduced me to data analysis, which I realized is relevant and applicable in nearly every field of work.
      Obtaining my Applied Statistical Modeling certificate provided me with first experiences in statistical methods and programming. 
      I decided to pursue graduate studies in this field because I've felt drawn to the capabilities of data-driven solutions.
      
      I hope to use data to make informed decisions about the future and reduce the error and risk accompanied by change.
      With the amount of data generated in our day-to-day lives, we have the potential to solve global contemporary issues using minimal resources and time. 
      Although I am still learning, I have come to enjoy the process of wrangling/cleaning datasets, building predictive models, and visualizing the results.
